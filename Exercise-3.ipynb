    "Exercise 3 includes a **written assignment** (10 points), a **programming assignment with 3 problems** (9 points) and a **feedback/workload assessment assignment** (1 point). For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own programming solutions or written text. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case your computer crashes (can happen!).\n",

Please notice that finishing the programming exercises can take significant amount of time (especially if you don't have yet much programming experience). Hence, it is recommended that you start immediately working on them."

    "\n",
    "In this problem, the idea is to reduce the number of observations by resampling our data (i.e. only keeping record every 10 seconds) and create an animation out of our data. For doing this, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Group the GPS observations that you selected and filtered in the previous problem based on `vehicle_id` and `direction_id` using the `groupby()` -function of pandas.\n",
    "2. Iterate over the groups and **for each group**:\n",
    "  - Resample the observations in a way that only one observation per 10 seconds is kept (i.e. reducing the number of observations). You can do this by chaining the following commands together: \n",
    "    1. Resample the group using `.resample()` -function of pandas with 10 second threshold. This returns a set of samples where observations within 10 seconds are grouped together. \n",
    "    2. From the output of the previous step, keep only the first observation of each sample using the `.first()` -function of pandas. This will reduce the number of observations so that only 1 observation per 10 seconds is kept.\n",
    "  - Store the resulting sample GeoDataFrame into a list `sampled`\n",
    "  - **Hint / Good programming practice:** *When programming something like this, where functionality should be implemented inside a loop, it is highly useful to use `break` command as the last intended line in the loop. This will stop the loop after the first iteration, and it is easier (and faster) to investigate what is happening inside the loop by checking the variable values. ([see examples here](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-break/))*\n",
    "3. Combine all the GeoDataFrames stored in `sampled` list into a single GeoDataFrame (check [pd.concat()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html))\n",
    "4. Drop all empty geometries from the combined GeoDataFrame\n",
    "5. Make a copy of the combined GeoDataFrame and store it into a new variable `visualization_data`, and\n",
    "  - Reset the index of the GeoDataFrame and drop the column `time` (i.e. the DateTime information)\n",
    "  - Select only following columns from the combined GeoDataFrame `\"geometry\", \"speed\", \"timestamp\", \"direction_id\", \"vehicle_id\", \"route_id\"`\n",
    "7. Create an animation based on the `visualization_data` with KeplerGl following the example that was shown during the lesson. The output animation could look something like [following](https://sustainability-gis-2021.github.io/examples/Helsinki_PT_Trajectories.html) (be patient, it takes a moment to load the visualization) in which the speed is used as source for coloring the points."

    "2. Iterate over the groups and on each iteration:\n",
    "  - Create a trajectory collection out of the group if the maximum speed of the observations is larger than 0 (reported as meters per second)\n",
    "  - Split the trajectory based on criteria that if there is a 5-minute time gap between observations, the trajectory should be splitted into multiple ones. Use the `mpd.ObservationGapSplitter()` functionality to do this (find information from the movingpandas docs).\n",
    "  - Calculate the speed for each of these trajectories as **kilometers per hour** and select only observations where the speed is at least 1 kmph\n",
    "  - Calculate the average and standard deviation of the speed (in kmph)\n",
    "  - Create a LineString geometry out of the observations\n",
    "  - Parse other useful information from the trajectory (should be a single value): vehicle_id, route_id, direction_id and start_time (i.e. what was the first timestamp of the trajectory).\n",
